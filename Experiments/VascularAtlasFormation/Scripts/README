!!!CAUTION!!!: The vascular atlas generation experiments are highly experimental at
the current stage.

The AtlasGenerationDriver.py is the central script that coordinates and runs the
atlas generation procedure. It can serve as an template for any further experiments
that might be added to TubeTK in the future.

Type

$ python AtlasGenerationDriver.py --help

to get a list of available command line options.

An exemplary call looks like

$python AtlasGenerationDriver.py --dest /tmp/ --data Data.json --cvruns 3 --config Config.json \
  --phantom /Data/BrainWebPhantom/phantom.mha --cells 500 --stage=4

which runs the fourth stage of atlas generation. For a more detailed description of the various
stages of processing, it is useful to take a look at the in-code documentation of the
AtlasGenerationDriver.py script.

Two core command-line parameters are the '--data' (set to 'Data.json') and the '--config'
parameter (set to 'Config.json' in the example). For both JSON files, examples exist in the
current directory.

'Config.json' sets the paths of all the executables that are used during atlas generation. The
paths are relativ to the TubeTK build directory, which as to be set on the command line as

$ export TUBETK_BUILD=<PathToTubeTKBuild>

'Data.json' contains the absolute paths for the source data -
here male and female vascular networks as well as corresponding MRA and MRI (T1) images. The
'--phantom' parameter specifies the phantom to use (here BrainWeb T1 phantom). To understand
the remaining parameters, please read the original publication in the 'Resources\' directory.
