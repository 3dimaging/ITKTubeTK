DESCRIPTION
===========

TubeTKLib (http://www.tubetk.org) is an open-source toolkit for the segmentation,
registration, and analysis of tubes and surfaces in images, developed by
Kitware, Inc.

Tubes and surfaces, as generalized 1D and 2D manifolds in N-dimensional images,
are essential components in a variety of image analysis tasks. Instances of
tubular structures in images include blood vessels in magnetic resonance
angiograms and b-mode ultrasound images, wires in microscopy images of
integrated circuits, roads in aerial photographs, and nerves in confocal
microscopy.

A guiding premise of TubeTKLib is that by focusing on 1D and 2D manifolds we can
devise methods that are insensitive to the modality, noise, contrast, and scale
of the images being analyzed and to the arrangement and deformations of the
objects in them. In particular, we propose that TubeTKLib's manifold methods offer
improved performance for many applications, compared to methods involving the
analysis of independent geometric measures (e.g., edges and corners) or
requiring complete shape models.

TubeTKLib makes extensive use of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
(ITK) and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Select methods of TubeTKLib are provided
as command-line applications.
